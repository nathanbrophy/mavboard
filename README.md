## Developing code

### Compiling

Core Javascript files live in the src/public/javascript directory.  To compile changes: `% npm start` will run the grunt script to compile and launch the server.   

### Continuing Development

This project was forked from a student lead project from Maverick Software Consulting, that I was able to head for a little less than a year.  A lot of great progress was made on it, and this is a lite version of it that continues off of the music player functionality.
